      <Treatment-Protocol>
Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit using 100ng RNA input and 13 PCR cycles.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

Basecalling was performed on-instrument and converted to FASTQ using bcl2fastq v2.17.
Adapters were trimmed using Cutadapt v1.13, reads aligning to the repeatmasker or Illumina iGenomes abundant sequences using Bowtie2 v2.2.6 were discarded. Unaligned reads were then aligned to the Ensembl release 84 transcriptome using HISAT2 v2.0.4.
Transcript isoform level abundances were calculated using Kallisto v0.43 and normalized between samples.
Transcript abundances were aggregated to the gene-level using tximport.

Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

    <Data-Processing>
Basecalling was performed on-instrument and converted to FASTQ using bcl2fastq v2.17.
Adapters were trimmed using Cutadapt v1.13, reads aligning to the repeatmasker or Illumina iGenomes abundant sequences using Bowtie2 v2.2.6 were discarded. Unaligned reads were then aligned to the Ensembl release 84 transcriptome using HISAT2 v2.0.4.
Transcript isoform level abundances were calculated using Kallisto v0.43 and normalized between samples.
Transcript abundances were aggregated to the gene-level using tximport.
Genome_build: GRCh38
Supplementary_files_format_and_content: TSV files include TPM (transcripts per million) for Ensembl transcripts from protein coding genes in release 84.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit using 100ng RNA input and 13 PCR cycles.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit using 100ng RNA input and 13 PCR cycles.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells were grown according to cell-type specific requirements and were actively growing when harvested

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit using 100ng RNA input and 13 PCR cycles.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit using 100ng RNA input and 13 PCR cycles.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

Libraries were prepared using a slightly modified version of the ribosome profiling protocol (Ingolia 2012). Protected footprints were generated by RNase digestion; fragmented RNA was generated using limited alkaline hydrolysis.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

Media was aspirated and replaced by PBS + 100 ug/ml cycloheximide and incubated at 37 °C for ten minutes. Cells were isolated with type-specific protease and lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer by ten strokes through a 26-gauge needle and nuclei were pelleted at 1,500g for 5 minutes. Lysate from ~10 million cells was layered on top of 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 100 ug/ml cycloheximide).  Gradients were centrifuged for 2 hours at 36,000 RPM in a SW-41 rotor, punctured, and manually peak fractionated using real-time A260 monitoring with a Brandel gradient fractionator and ISCO UA-6 detector.

Libraries were prepared using a slightly modified version of the ribosome profiling protocol (Ingolia 2012). Protected footprints were generated by RNase digestion; fragmented RNA was generated using limited alkaline hydrolysis.
Polysomal RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient fractions by ethanol precipitation. RNA was then DNase treated, subjected to acid phenol:chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitated. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA was extracted using TRIzol extraction (Life Technologies) and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA integrity was verified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent).

    <Title>Widespread translational remodeling during human neuronal differentiation</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE100007</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>29141229</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Faithful cellular differentiation requires precise coordination of changes in gene expression. However, the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational regulation during human cellular differentiation are unclear. Here, we induced forebrain neuronal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and characterized genome-wide RNA and translation levels during neurogenesis. We find that thousands of genes change at the translation level across differentiation without a corresponding change in RNA level. Specifically, we identify mTOR complex 1 signaling as a key driver for elevated translation of translation-related genes in hESCs. In contrast, translational repression in active neurons is mediated by transcript 3′ UTRs, through regulatory sequences. Together, our findings identify a functional role for the dramatic 3′ UTR extensions that occur during brain development, and provide insights to interpret genetic variants in post-transcriptional control factors that influence neurodevelopmental disorders and diseases. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Forebrain neural cultures differentiated from human embryonic stem cells were isolated and cellular RNA, polysomal RNA, and ribosome protected footprints were deep sequenced.
