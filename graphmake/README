To create reports, call

$ python tablulate_reads.py bipolar
$ python tablulate_reads.py normal

Output should be in /misc/pipeline42/mbelmadani/rnaseq/reports

The class Utils from "utils.py" does the actual computations, parsing, etc. The tablulate_reads.py files only handles creation of paths and delegating the proper information to utils.

The total_htcounts.sh script is a bash scripts called by tabulate_reads.py go the the total number of reads mapped to genes in the htseq output

The report_genes.sh script will create a summary of which genes have the highest counts for bipolar and normal sets
